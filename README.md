Interactive web game GUI

Hi all,

the codes that I am sharing here are essencially a complete packbone of a javascript-based online MMO game with Python back end.

I have deplyed the game on an EC2 server so please free to play it here http://crazyplanes.ai-mmo-games.de .

I will gradually be adding more comments and clean up the code.
